## Getting Started

This project is a client-side application built without a complex build setup. It can be run locally with a simple web server.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   A way to serve static files. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `serve`.

### Configuration

The application requires an API key from the AI service provider to function.

1.  **Obtain an API Key:** Get an API key from the provider that powers the underlying language model.
2.  **Set Environment Variable:** The application's code expects the key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. You must configure this in the environment where you deploy or run the application. Without this key, the chat interface will be disabled.

### Running Locally

1.  **Download the Files:** Place all the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) into a single directory on your computer.

2.  **Start a Local Server:** Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run one of the following commands:

    *   **Using the Node.js `serve` package:**
        ```bash
        npx serve
        ```

    *   **Using Python:**
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python3 -m http.server
        ```

3.  **Open in Browser:** The command will output a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8000`). Open this URL in your web browser to use MediQuery.
